# Hookd
This is an app designed to make fishing more productive. Imagine bobber fishing, but without the time-consuming task of staring for hours at a time at your bobber, waiting for a fish to bite. This app will completely remove the unnecessary need to constantly watch your bobber! 

# How to use
1. Download the app through [this link](testflight.apple.com/join/FfS1Zjnw)
2. Cast your rod
3. Press "start streaming" in the app and point your phone at your bobber
4. Do something productive (stop staring into the soul of your bobber) and let the app alert you when a fish bites!

# How it works
Whenever Hookd doens't detect your bobber, it alerts you with notifications and vibrations!

Try it out!
